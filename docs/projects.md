#### `July 2024`

**Web Application Development with a Jenkins Pipeline Triggered by GitHub Web-hook Integration**

_Ansible, Git, Unix Shell, Docker, Jenkins, VS Code, HTML/CSS._

- The project aims to automate the building, testing, and deployment process of a web application using Jenkins and
  GitHub. The Jenkins pipeline will be triggered automatically by GitHub web-hook integration when changes are
  made to the code repository. The pipeline will include stages such as building, testing, and deploying the
  application.

### `January 2024`

**Deploying a Multi-Tier Website Using AWS EC2**

_EC2 Instanc, AutoScaling and RDS Instance_

- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services
  (AWS) cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front so you can develop and
  deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need,
  configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle
  changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.

### `2022 - 2023`

**[India Driving Dataset (IDD Datasets) and IHub Data Mobility](https://insaan.iiit.ac.in/)**

_Data Collection and Data management and verification using Python, Shell Script_

- While several datasets for autonomous navigation have become available in recent years, they tend to focus on
  structured driving environments. This usually corresponds to well-delineated infrastructure such as lanes, a small
  number of well-defined categories for traffic participants, low variation in object or background appearance and
  strict adherence to traffic rules. We propose IDD, a novel dataset for road scene understanding in unstructured
  environments where the above assumptions are largely not satisfied.

- For more than 20 years, IIIT-Hyderabad (IIITH) has been dedicated to enhancing the quality of education in
  cutting-edge areas of Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) through strong research programs in
  machine learning, image processing, computer vision, robotics, natural language processing, pattern recognition,
  and speech processing. IHub-Data, IIIT-Hyderabad is one of the 25 Technology Innovation Hubs (TIHs) established
  under the National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber - Physical Systems (NM-ICPS) by DST, Government of
  India.

### `2019 - 2022`

**[Ego4D: Around the World in 3,000 Hours of Egocentric Video](https://ego4d-data.org/)**

_Data Collection and Data management and verification using Python, Shell Script_

- At IIIT Hyderabad, we recorded 660.5 hours of data with the help of 138 subjects. The videos were collected in 5
  different states in India, geographically well apart. We cover 36 different scenarios, such as making bricks using
  hands, knitting, making egg cartons, and hairstyling. The age of subjects ranged from 18-84 years with 10 distinct
  professional backgrounds teachers, students, farmers, blacksmiths, homemakers, etc. Out of all the subjects, 94
  were males, and 44 were females. We use GoPro Hero 6 and GoPro Hero 7 for recording the videos. The GoProâ€™s
  were shipped to the participants in different parts of the country. Videos were shared back either in external hard
  disks or over the cloud storage. Each video was manually inspected for any sensitive content before sharing.

### `2017 - 2019`
